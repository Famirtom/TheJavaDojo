# ü•ã The Java Dojo: A Learning Journey

Welcome to **The Java Dojo**! This repository is my personal training ground for mastering the Java programming language. It serves as a categorized collection of exercises, coding challenges, and small projects designed to track my progress and solidify my understanding of various Java concepts.

Think of this as my **code notebook**‚Äîa place where theoretical knowledge is put into practical execution.

## üèóÔ∏è Repository Structure

The exercises and challenges are organized into distinct folders, or "genres," to facilitate focused practice and easy navigation. This categorization reflects the different areas of Java development I am currently exploring:

| Folder Name (Example) | What's Inside | What I Am Mainly Learning |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `01_Language_Basics` | Simple exercises: how to write commands, use variables, and create basic "if/then" statements and loops. | The **building blocks** of Java. |
| `02_Objects_And_Fields` | Exercises on how to create **objects** (e.g., a car, an animal) and how to make them interact. | The **"OOP"** method (Object-Oriented Programming). |
| `03_Lists_And_Maps` | Exercises on using Java's lists, sets, and maps to **store and manage** groups of data. | How to organize data efficiently. |
| `04_Problem_Solving` | Solutions to more complex problems (e.g., sorting long lists of numbers, finding the fastest path). | **Logic** and programmer thinking. |
| `05_Reading_Writing_Files` | Exercises on how the program can **read data from a file** (text, etc.) or **save data** to a file. | Working with computer files. |
| `06_Parallel_Code` | Advanced exercises on making the program do **multiple things at the same time** (helpful for fast applications). | **Multi-threading** execution. |
| `...` | *I will add new folders as I learn new and more advanced things.* | |
